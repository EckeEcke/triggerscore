      "headline": "Triggerscore - a new way to watch old movies",
      "paragraph1": "The idea for Triggerscore resulted from my newly discovered guilty pleasure: zapping Netflix for old movies (especially from the 90s) and analyse how much these old movies would trigger viewers today. Triggerscore serves as a portal, where users can find and submit Triggerscore-ratings.",
      "paragraph2": "Triggerscore is a solo project. Idea, conception, design aswell as developement of front- and backend are all done by myself. The frontend is based on the JavaScript framework Vue.js using Vuex-Store for state management and CSS framework Tailwind. The frontend of my applicaton is hosted on Netlify. For the backend I use a MySQL databse amd a NodeJS-Server, both hosted on Heroku. My backend application receives ratings from my frontend and saves them in my database. It also reads and serves ratings from my database aswell as calculates the scores. As a movie database I use the TMDB api and JustWatch api for available streaming providers."

      "answer2": "To rate a movie simply search for the title or click one of the existing titles. Give a score for every of the four categories and submit your rating. Signing in is not necessary.",
      "question3": "Is any personal data saved when I submit a rating?",
      "answer3": "No, in the rating database only the submitted rating and a movie id are being saved.",
      "question4": "Where is all the movie data coming from?",
      "answer4": "Triggerscore uses the TMDB api. Furthermore the applicaton uses the JustWatch api to receive information about availabity of movies on different streaming providers. The Triggerscore itself is only provided by and for Triggerscore."
